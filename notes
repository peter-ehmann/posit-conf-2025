Session 1 - ROI in Open Source

Why use open source? collaboration, faster innovation
  - not just R, but python
  - opens up talent pool
  - not spending time training to learn SAS
  - what are students coding in grad school
What is the ROI? difficult to measure
  - prove it with POC
  - tipping point (financial cost)
    - propriety vs.
    - open-source
  - experiment SAS vs. R timing to program SDTM tables 
    - automation
    - customization
    - final product
  - not just cost, but mindset shift
  - PMQTS - analagous to shift from siloed coding to best practices
    - savings are not apparent up-front
    - ROI is difficult to calculate and communicate
    - POC and reach tipping point
Who do we need to influence? health authorities, business IT
What to demystify? validation, reproducibility, open-source

Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) are two distinct but interconnected components
crucial to ensuring pharmaceutical products' safety, efficacy, and reliability. QA and QC in the
pharmaceutical industry collectively form a comprehensive framework for maintaining high-quality
standards throughout pharmaceutical manufacturing.

  - TFL generation
  - Multi use tools: shiny, packages (don't have to start from skratch)
  - Data repository
  
  - User facing vs. Quality facing documentation (know your audience)
  - User -> see underlying code and flag issues
  - Quality -> should know author(s) and tests performed --- maintenance strategy
  - Maintenance
    - project re-assinged
    - employee leaves - turnover
    - phase out
    - GIT!!! - learning curve is steep (barrier to entry)
      - development
      - transparency
      - branching - try things and not break
    - standardization vs. harmonization !!!
    - consider yourself as a collaborator
    - intangible
      - investment
      - eliminating resistance to change
      - embrace new approaches
      - speak the same language (get on the same level) - use non-technical terms
      - "thats how it worked before" is not a reason (ex Gen AI)
