QA and QC in the pharmaceutical industry collectively form a comprehensive framework for maintaining high-quality standards throughout pharmaceutical manufacturing.\n\n\nBenefits of open-source\n\nTFL generation\nMulti use tools: shiny, packages (don’t have to start from skratch)\nData repository\n\n\n\nWhy open-source\n\nUser facing vs. Quality facing documentation (know your audience)\nUser -&gt; see underlying code and flag issues\nQuality -&gt; should know author(s) and tests performed (maintenance strategy)\nMaintenance\n\nproject re-assinged\nemployee leaves (turnover)\nphase out\nGIT!!! - learning curve is steep (barrier to entry)\n\ndevelopment\ntransparency\nbranching - try things and not break\n\nstandardization vs. harmonization !!!\nconsider yourself as a collaborator\nintangible\n\ninvestment\neliminating resistance to change\nembrace new approaches\nspeak the same language (get on the same level) - use non-technical terms\n“thats how it worked before” is not a reason (ex Gen AI)\nrigid vs flexible mindset"
