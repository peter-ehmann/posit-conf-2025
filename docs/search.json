QA and QC in the pharmaceutical industry collectively form a comprehensive framework for maintaining high-quality standards throughout pharmaceutical manufacturing.\n\n\nBenefits of open-source\n\nTFL generation\nMulti use tools: shiny, packages (don’t have to start from skratch)\nData repository\n\n\n\nWhy open-source\n\nUser facing vs. Quality facing documentation (know your audience)\nUser -&gt; see underlying code and flag issues\nQuality -&gt; should know author(s) and tests performed (maintenance strategy)\nMaintenance\n\nproject re-assinged\nemployee leaves (turnover)\nphase out\nGIT!!! - learning curve is steep (barrier to entry)\n\ndevelopment\ntransparency\nbranching - try things and not break\n\nstandardization vs. harmonization !!!\nconsider yourself as a collaborator\nintangible\n\ninvestment\neliminating resistance to change\nembrace new approaches\nspeak the same language (get on the same level) - use non-technical terms\n“thats how it worked before” is not a reason (ex Gen AI)\nrigid vs flexible mindset\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenAI and Clinical Trials\n\nGilead\nEli Lilly\n\n\nLLMs\n\nLLM is an instruction following engine with no memory\nProvide:\n\nprecise instructions\nsupply the right information at the right time\n\nTool Calls\nModel, Context, Protocol (MCP)\nevals are critical for testing and development\nwe can’t test everything, and LLMs will screw up\n\nadopt version control (oversight)\n\ncreate ways to find errors\nCurrent state: do not make plans before piloting\n\nplay with current tools\ndo not plan to put things in production in 2025\nfigure out what it is good at, vs not good at\n\nUse cases:\n\nmostly documentation\nnobody mentioned as junior analyst (@Natalie)\n\nBuild foundation to be ready when the models improve\nIs it doing what it’s meant to do?\n\nGive it to high performers\nIf it fails, it will get shut down early.\n\n\n\n\nComprehensive C-QT Analysis From Data to Deliverables\nhttps://a2-ai.github.io/cqtkit-docs/versions/1.0.2/\n\n\n\nGenAI in Positron\n\nPolyglot IDE - R, Python, SQL, Rust, Julia,\nFork of VS Code\nClaude integration into Positron\n\nknows all environment variables\n\n\n\n\nValidation Hub\n\nR consortium project\n10 organizations\nInvolvement from health authorities\n\n\n\nRoundtable 1 - Perspectives of CROs\n\nDenali\nCytel\nAtorus\nSyneos\n\nTakeaway: Need to have time for learning & leveling up to enable open-source adoption.\n\n\nRoundtable 2 - Open-Source Change Manangement\n\nGSK\nGenentech/Roche\n\nTakeaway: Trainings are ineffective, need to implement best practices in everyday work.\n\nGSK uses “just in time training”\nAdvanced programmer is teamed with novice programmer to implement best practices in a real-world setting\nCoders will only adopt change if they have to"
