### Keynote - Psychology of Tech

  - **Presenter:** Dr. Cat Hicks

  - Successful code is copied (social learning)
  - Solutions are improved by the group (cultural ratcheting)
  - Both tweaks and leaps
  - Most leaps fail, but wins = big advancement

#### Traps

  1. Brittle productivity trap
    - Only way to be productive is to "grind"
    - Short term hard effort looks cool
  2. Chilly climate trap
    - coder should be cold-nonHuman
  3. Lone genius trap
    - responsibility lies with a gifted few

#### Good Culture

  1. Learning culture
  2. Sense of agency
  3. Self-efficacy & motivation
  4. Sense of belonging
  
#### Cats Law

  - The more a software team fixates on short term performance, the less they protect the foundation of learning and improcemnt
  - "We have to deliver"
  
### Big Orgranizations

#### Data-as-a-product: A framework for collaborative data wrangling

 - **Clara Amorosi, Bristol Myers Squibb**
 - creating a data product object (more work now for less headaches later)
 - start with git, renv, pins, targets

#### Ripples of Change with R: Itâ€™s more than just coding

 - start with purpose (change in mindset before skills to learn R)
 - collaborate (open source - hope that your code is copied and used in the future)
 - learn by doing (projects that matter)
 - celebrate incremental progress

#### What R We Counting?

  - **Ben Arancibia, Director Data Science - Scientific and Adoption Lead for Open Source, GSK**
  - How is open-source adoption going? Simple question, hard to answer.
  - git is hard, have empathy for the transition

#### A tale of one organization: learning how to swim in the ocean of open source

  - learning is emotional
  - need management directive
  - hands on practice - code along sessions and Git together
  - use GenAI to learn
  - learning makes work fun

### ML and Statistical Modeling

### Enterprise-Level Data Platforms

#### Championing modern science workflows to benefit dairy farmers

  - Excel to R transition
  - Need persistence
